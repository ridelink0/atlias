// Benchmark tiers that actually run (NEXTGEN-4, build item 2).
//
// The complaint these checks answer is not that atlias had no benchmark. It had
// three, and the only one anybody ran end to end scored 0 of 27, which is a
// score no A/B can be built on. So the tiers have to be nameable from the CLI,
// honest about a corpus that is not on the machine, and reproducible task for
// task between two arms - and the big-file tier needs a grader that decides
// without installing Django.
