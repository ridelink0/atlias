// Turning somebody else's benchmark into tasks this machine can actually run.
//
// The measurement front of the round-three research was blunt about the eight
// shipped tasks: at that size the standard error is about sixteen points and one
// task flipping moves the score twelve and a half, so the corpus is a tripwire
// rather than a measurement. It was equally blunt about the fix. Aider's
// polyglot benchmark is 225 Exercism exercises - a stub, a test, and a reference
// solution - and while aider's *harness* needs Docker, the *data* does not. The
// Python half needs python and pytest, both of which are on this machine.
//
// The rule that makes a converted task worth anything is the same rule the eval
// runner already lives by: nothing is taken on trust. Every task is proved to
// fail with the stub in place and to pass with the exercise's own reference
// solution dropped in, on this machine, before it is written out. A task that
// cannot do both is not emitted, and the reason is reported - because a task
// that fails for a missing package measures the machine, not the harness.
